/* ENCAPSULATION
 * 1 - The class will be called Printer
2 - It will simulate a real Computer Printer
3 - It should have fields for the toner Level, number of pages printed, and also whether its a duplex 
printer (capable of printing on both sides of the paper).
4 - Add methods to fill up the toner (up to a maximum of 100%), another method to simulate printing 
a page (which should increase the number of pages printed).

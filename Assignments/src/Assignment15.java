/*
 * Write a method names sumFirstAndLastDigit with one parameter of type int called number.
The method needs to find the first and last digit of the parameter number passed to the method, using a loop 
and return the sum of the first and last digit of that number.
If the number is negative then the method needs to return -1 to indicate an invalid value.

Sample Output:
sumFirstAndLastDigit(252); //should return 4, first digit 2 and the last is 2 which gives us 2+2 and the sum is 4
sumFirstAndLastDigit(257); //should return 9, first digit 2 and the last is 9 which gives us 2+7 and the sum is 9
sumFirstAndLastDigit(0); //should return 0, first digit 0 and the last is 0 which gives us 0+0 and the sum is 0
sumFirstAndLastDigit(5); //should return 10, first digit 5 and the last is 5 which gives us 5+5 and the sum is 10
sumFirstAndLastDigit(-10); //should return -1, because the parameter is negative
